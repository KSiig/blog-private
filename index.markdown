â€‹I have a specialty in whatever interests me. I have a few passions; autonomy and cloud being the biggest. These two passions combined form the basis for most of my articles. I like to say that I want to help everyone around me be more knowledgeable than I am, and I want to know as much as possible.

That's what my blog is for. Writing helps me delve deeper into topics than I maybe otherwise would, and hopefully it helps someone else when they hit that same issue, that I've already had to deal with.
